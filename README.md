# Multi Answer Plugin
This plugin was created for an educational project. This plugin allows it to create challenges with multiple flags. The plugin will distribute rewards based on the amount of flags the user filled in correctly. So for example if a challenge has 2 flags and each flag is worth 20 points. If the user submitted only 1 correct flag, the plugin will award the user wih 20 points. If the user finds both the correct flags, the plugin will award the user with 40 points.
